traPyc
======

**traPyc** is an optics calculator for circular accelerator machines such as synchrotrons and storage rings. The name is
a word play between (ion) traffic and Python. Currently only linear elements are supported. The calculations are done in full matrices.

The input lattice file is just text file containing rows of elements. Future imports from other optics programs like MIRKO and MADX are planned.
